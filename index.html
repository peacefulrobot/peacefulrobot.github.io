<h2>About</h2><p>Peaceful Robot Cybersecurity is an independent research initiative providing
preventive measures for the secure software development lifecycle and creating
tools that leverage emerging technologies in Infrastructure-as-a-Service,
DevOps, developer toolkits, and cybersecurity. Funding is provided by bug
bounty programs and microservices of developed tools.</p>
<h2>Research</h2><p>Manual code review for information security weaknesses within assets written
in programming languages such as Python, Javascript, PHP, Java, and C#.</p>
<p>Normalize vulnerability patterns for various programming languages to discover
weaknesses during analysis using &quot;Cybersecurity unit testing&quot;.</p>
<p>Using Docker images, Chef recipes, and other automated toolkits such as
GruntJS, build scripts, etc stored in public git repositories to readily
integrate tools into the technology process lifecycle while still
maintaining auditability.</p>
  
  <p> Creating and researching new concepts as "Application Security as Code" 
    by automating application security architecture and design disciplines through 
    artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p>
    
<p>Active in bug bounty programs to test developed tools. </p>
